Description: A framework for predicting daily fishery outcomes from openers in the lower Kuskokwim River subsistence salmon fishery.
    Fishery outcomes include drift boat trips/day, salmon catch/trip, and % species composition, and these are treated as response variables in linear regression models with predictions made via AIC-based model-averaging.
    Harvest predictions by species are then obtained by multiplying predictions of the response variables. 
    Leave-one-out cross-validation is used to assess predictive performance.
    The principle user-facing feature is an interactive web application, which is a user-friendly interface to the predictive models and data and contains much information about how predictions are made and how well they perform.
